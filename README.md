# Loan Management System

This project is built using create-react-app

## Code Best Practices

Create a container inside [src/container] folder and a component inside [src/component] folder for every new module you want to add.
Please use separate styles.scss file for every component styling. Minimize use of inline styling.
Use only material UI v4 controls for implementation. Follow this link [Material-UI](https://v4.mui.com/).
Always export and import api function from [src/api/index.js] file.

Please add **comments** where necessary.
